# Methodology for building normalized Sentinel 2 mosaics

This project aims to develop a methodology for the creation of analytical images for each tile of the Sentinel 2 sensor, in the regions of Caatinga biome and the state of Bahia. Each analytical image will represent one whole year, and it will serve as base mosaic for 3 consecutive projects, in the areas of agriculture, mining and use and coverage mapping.
